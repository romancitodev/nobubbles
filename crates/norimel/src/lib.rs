//! rímel — blocks of styled text, lipgloss style.
//!
//! A [`Block`] is rows of styled runs plus tailwind-ish utilities: `bg`, `px`, `w`, `center`,
//! `rounded`. The utilities only take notes; the shape is composed once at the end, so they
//! commute and calling one twice doesn't stack.
//!
//! ```
//! use norimel::{self as rimel, Color};
//!
//! let badge = rimel::text("astro").bg(Color::Magenta).fg(Color::Black).bold().px(1);
//! println!("{}", rimel::row([badge, rimel::text("  ready in 300ms")]));
//! ```
//!
//! Two ways out of the same block: [`Display`](std::fmt::Display) writes ANSI for a
//! `println!`, [`Block::runs`] hands the placed runs to whoever paints cells. Runs are never
//! flattened into a string, so measuring and joining never parses ANSI back out.
//!
//! # Animation
//!
//! There is no timeline in here and no scheduler. An animation is a function from a clock to a
//! block, and you build the block again every frame. That is the whole model. Everything below
//! is either a shortcut for a common case or a way of telling the drawer what you are up to.
//!
//! ## Who asks for the next frame
//!
//! A terminal UI only repaints when something says it should — nobubbles sleeps on an idle
//! timeout otherwise — so a block that changes on its own has to admit it.
//! [`Block::is_animated`] is that admission, and whoever draws the block reads it.
//!
//! [`Block::animate`] and [`Block::pulse`] set it for you. When the movement is yours, say so
//! with [`Block::animated`]. Forget it and you hit the bug everybody hits once: the ramp looks
//! lovely for a single frame and then sits there until you press a key.
//!
//! ## The two motions that ship
//!
//! [`Block::animate`] lays the ramp across the columns and slides it sideways. Every character
//! sits on a different point of the ramp, so the colours travel through the text.
//!
//! [`Block::pulse`] gives the whole block one colour and walks *that* along the ramp. Nothing
//! travels; the block breathes.
//!
//! Both take a speed in turns of the ramp per second. Roughly: 0.1 crawls, 0.5 reads as
//! moving, past 1.0 it starts to strobe. They share one clock, started the first time anything
//! animated is composed, so two blocks at the same speed stay in step — which is usually what
//! you want and is worth knowing when it isn't.
//!
//! ## Your own ramp
//!
//! [`Ramp`] wraps a [`colorgrad`] gradient, and that crate is re-exported here so you don't
//! need it in your own manifest. The presets cover the wheel; anything else is a builder away.
//!
//! One trap, and it is the only one: a ramp for [`Block::pulse`] has to come back to where it
//! started. A ramp that runs dim to bright and stops will snap back at the wrap and you get a
//! flicker instead of a breath. Put the first colour last too.
//!
//! ## Your own motion
//!
//! [`Block::map_cells`] is the escape hatch. It hands you every cell after the shape is
//! settled — the column, the row, and the style that cell ended up with, padding and border and
//! joins all accounted for — and takes back the style you want:
//!
//! ```
//! use norimel::{self as rimel, Block, Color};
//!
//! /// A bright band travelling left to right through whatever it is given.
//! fn scan(block: Block, seconds: f32) -> Block {
//!   let head = seconds * 18.0;
//!
//!   block
//!     .map_cells(|column, _row, style| {
//!       let distance = (head - f32::from(column)).rem_euclid(24.0);
//!       if distance < 3.0 {
//!         style.fg(Color::White).bold()
//!       } else {
//!         style.fg(Color::DarkGray)
//!       }
//!     })
//!     .animated()
//! }
//!
//! let line = scan(rimel::text("reticulating splines"), 0.4);
//! assert_eq!(line.size(), (20, 1));
//! ```
//!
//! That is a complete effect. It works on any block, it composes with everything else, and it
//! lives in your crate.
//!
//! Two things to know before you write one. The block comes back **composed**, so utilities you
//! apply afterwards wrap what you painted rather than reaching back into it — which is how you
//! put a plain border around a scanning line. And `map_cells` splits the block into one run per
//! grapheme, because that is the only way `column` can mean anything; irrelevant for a title,
//! worth a thought if you are running it over a full screen every frame.
